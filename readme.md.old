### ***Making capes easier for Minecraft client and mod developers.***

## About
Capes API is built by [Halfpetal](http://halfpetal.com) to help client and mod developers for Minecraft implement custom capes into their system.

Our goal is to create a simple, straight-forward system that anyone can just hop into and learn. We've made it  easy with our client developer made [client implementation](https://github.com/halfpetal/CapesAPI-ClientImplementation) to integrate our system into any client. It's so simple, we might as well call it drag-and-drop. It will make you say, "why hasn't anyone done this sooner?"

We're looking forward to working with all the new (and old) developers that will help make CapesAPI a wonderful service to everyone.

## v2.0
Version 2.0 is our next major release of CapesAPI and it's a full rewrite of the project. Version 1 is great, don't get us wrong, but it definitely lacks in many areas. It suits the needs as a minimum viable product, but it wouldn't for a full fledged system. Version 2 will introduce many new features that will make the entire system much more appealing, especially for the cape designers and the everyday player.

You can keep up with the progress on the [project page here](https://github.com/halfpetal/CapesAPI/projects/1) or on the [branch here](https://github.com/halfpetal/CapesAPI/tree/dev-2.0.0)
