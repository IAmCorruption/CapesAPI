## CapesAPI Public is now Archived
It's been months since we updated CapesAPI on the public repositories (around 8 months as of today) and have decided to rewrite CapesAPI 2 from the ground up using Laravel 5.5. We decided that CapesAPI 2 and all future releases will be closed source. 

With some of the features in CapesAPI 2 (including the in-site economy known as Diamonds) we wanted to ensure the protection of our users, of our code, and of our property. So, CapesAPI will now be archived.

Thank you all and see you soon!
